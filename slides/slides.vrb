Syntax of the \texttt{if}-command
\begin{verbatim}
    if([condition]) {
       [commands]
    }
\end{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
\item The condition must not be a vector
(else only its first element is used)
\item If there is just a single command, the brackets can be omitted
\item The opening curly bracket must appear in the same line as the \texttt{%
if}-command
\item It is possible to add \texttt{else \{[commands]\}}
\end{itemize}
